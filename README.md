# Unity Project RAD Y1

A Unity-based game/application developed for RAD Year 1 (first year of the RAD course).

---

## Overview

This project is a Unity application/game created as part of the RAD Year 1 course. It showcases concepts such as user input, scene management, UI, and possibly some gameplay mechanics. The goal was to implement interactive features, basic game logic, and learning how to manage different parts of a Unity project effectively.

## Features

(Some or all of the following – customise as relevant)

* Multiple scenes (menus, game level, maybe login or splash screens)
* Player control / movement
* Score or game state tracking
* UI elements (buttons, text, panels)
* Asset management (sprites/models, materials, audio)
* A “Work Log” file to track what was done (e.g. *MyWorkLog.txt*)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Unity (version used in development; e.g. Unity 2020.x / 2021.x / 2022.x)
* Git
* Optional: Visual Studio / VS Code (for editing scripts)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viterUA/Unity-Project-RAD-Y1.git
   ```
2. Open Unity Hub, then **Add** the cloned folder as a project (if not opened automatically).
3. Allow Unity to import all assets & resolve any missing packages.

### Running the Project

* In Unity Editor, open the main scene (or the scene designated as entry point)
* Hit **Play** to test in editor
* Build settings: configure platform (e.g. Windows / WebGL / Android) if you want to export

## Project Structure

Here's a rough outline of what the folders / files are for:

```
/Assets           → Unity-assets: scenes, scripts, prefabs etc.  
/ProjectSettings  → Contains project configuration settings for Unity.  
MyWorkLog.txt     → A file documenting work done / progress.  
(space war), (loginthesky) → Likely scene or script files related to game levels or features.  
```

You can extend this section with all major directories and their roles (Scripts, Scenes, Prefabs, UI, Audio etc.).

## Contributors

* (*Your Name / Team*) – primary developer(s)
* Anyone else who helped (if applicable)

## Roadmap / Future Work

Possible improvements you might consider:

* Polish visuals / UI designs
* Add sound effects / background music
* Implement more gameplay features (enemy AI, scoring, levels)
* Optimize performance for target platform
* More robust user input / control options
* Testing & bug fixes


If you like, I can generate a README version exactly adapted to what is inside the project (listing actual scenes, scripts etc.). Do you want me to do that?
